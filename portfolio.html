    <h2>Blown To Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>In the blown to bits reading it talked about how every thing on the interent is open to everyone. Nothing on the internet is safe even if you take every precaution posible. Some wesites have a private option but it does not actually keep it private, It more or less makes it less accesible. Once you put something on the internet it will be somewhere in a system somewhere. When we were little we thought once we clicked delete it was gone forever, but little did we know it is still somewhere on the internet tothis day</p>
    <h2>Light bot Reflection</h2>
    <p>The Lightbot is like a computer because the only way to move him around is to command him to. With a computer it wont do anything without you telling it to do something. With the lightbot it had multiple progrmas you could code just like coding on a real coding system. Lightbot is not like a computer because he is not able to run without someone controlling him. We inputed codes to move lightbot to go turn on squares using differnt commands that were given to us. On a real system you would not be provided with commands</p>
