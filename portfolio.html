    <h2>Blown To Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>In the blown to bits reading it talked about how every thing on the interent is open to everyone. Nothing on the internet is safe even if you take every precaution posible. Some wesites have a private option but it does not actually keep it private, It more or less makes it less accesible. Once you put something on the internet it will be somewhere in a system somewhere. When we were little we thought once we clicked delete it was gone forever, but little did we know it is still somewhere on the internet tothis day</p>
    <h2>Light bot Reflection</h2>
    <p>The Lightbot is like a computer because the only way to move him around is to command him to. With a computer it wont do anything without you telling it to do something. With the lightbot it had multiple progrmas you could code just like coding on a real coding system. Lightbot is not like a computer because he is not able to run without someone controlling him. We inputed codes to move lightbot to go turn on squares using differnt commands that were given to us. On a real system you would not be provided with commands</p>

    <h2>Stratch Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. Its a good idea to program in small pieces because if something doesent work you khow where the erroe is.</p>
    <p>2. Other tasks that take multiple tries are things like repairs for cars. Programming is similar because you are using a system to fix parts.</p>
    <p>3. I worked well with a partner because when i couldnt see a problem he usally did. I could improve next time by helping him more.</p>
    <p>4. With the more advanced computers it already looks like its doing a lot more than it actually is, and when its doing just as much as old computers it looks like more.</p>
    <h2>Objects and Methods</h2>
    <p>1. Because If all the sprites made a different noise at the same time you would not be able to tell which sprite is making what noise, and it would get annoying.</p>
    <p>2. I think the events are what happens when you clicka  certain sprite.</p>
    <p>3. A. The handler can only press 1 button an multiple things happen after the button is pressed. B. It would be convienet if you could change the volume of the sax.</p>
    <h2>1.2.2 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. They are the same because in scratch you use building blocks to code the project and in appinventor it works the same way.</p>
    <p>2. Having the ability to change programming will change society because today all we use in our devices whether we are playing a game or contacting a family member that lives on th other side of the world. It will change our society because we will keep advancing our technology to stay in contact with everyone.</p>
    <h2>1.2.3 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1.It is similar to scratch because they both use blocks but are diffrent becasue you can involve the sensors from your phone</p>
    <p>2. You can use sensors that a cell phone has that a computer does not.</p>
    <h2>1.3.3 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. They are the commands that the program that are called after the indent. </p>
    <p>2. We have learned True, False, or, and not. I learned Greater than.</p>
    <p>3. All of there  claims are correct. Jayl is correct because it is easier to correct later. Kendra is also correct but the coputer memory is small.</p>
    <h2>1.3.4 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. They both make sure you code get thoroughly inspected for error.</p>   
    <p>2. An if-elif-elif-else structure will always execute 1 block of code. . If the structure has nested conditions, several blocks of code might execute:</p>
    <p>3. A test suite runs other code several times, providing different input.</p>
    <h2>1.1.4 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. This is useful because in a program with lots of sprites and actions.it is easy to get confused and lose track of where each program is.</p>
    <p>2. I think that an event is what is going on in the program and a handle is a title or tag that a program has.</p>
    <p>3A. PlayG() is saying that when something happens to the G costume it should run the program or code that is inside of it.</p>
    <p>3B. It would be convenient if they could show parts of the program that are inside other commands.</p>
    <h2>1.4.2 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. The difference between an absolute and relative file names is that absolute files hold much more data.</p>
    <p>2. An object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method.</p>
    <p>3. Properties are a sorting system while a method is like a function that has a certian role.</p>
    <p>4. Putting a method on an object is like puting a function in another function.</p>
