    <p>Blown To Bits Reflection</p>
    <p>In the blown to bits reading it talked about how every thing on the interent is open to everyone. Nothing on the internet is safe even if you take every precaution posible. Some wesites have a private option but it does not actually keep it private, It more or less makes it less accesible. Once you put something on the internet it will be somewhere in a system somewhere. When we were little we thought once we clicked delete it was gone forever, but little did we know it is still somewhere on the internet tothis day</p>
